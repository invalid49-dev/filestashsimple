# GitHub Repository Creation Instructions

## Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since GitHub CLI is not available, please follow these steps to create the repository manually:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `filestash-simple`
   - **Description**: `Simple and fast file manager built with Node.js and SQLite`
   - **Visibility**: Public (make sure "Public" is selected)
   - **Initialize repository**: Leave unchecked (we already have code)
   - **Add .gitignore**: None (we already have one)
   - **Add a license**: None (we'll add MIT license later)

5. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Copy Repository URL

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. 
Copy the HTTPS URL which should look like:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/filestash-simple.git`

### Step 3: Return to this terminal

Once you have created the repository and copied the URL, I will proceed with adding the remote origin and pushing the code.
