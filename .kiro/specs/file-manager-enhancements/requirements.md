# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines enhancements to the file manager interface to improve user experience through visual indicators for database-tracked files, interface simplification, and better control over scanning operations.

## Glossary

- **File_Manager**: The web-based file browser interface that displays directory structures and files
- **Database_Tracked_Files**: Files and folders that have been previously scanned and stored in the SQLite database
- **Scanning_Operation**: The process of reading directory structures and storing file/folder information in the database
- **UI_Controls**: Interactive elements in the file manager interface (buttons, indicators, etc.)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to visually identify which files and folders are already stored in the database, so that I can quickly distinguish between tracked and untracked items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE File_Manager displays a file or folder, THE File_Manager SHALL apply a soft green background color IF the item exists in the database
2. THE File_Manager SHALL query the database to determine tracking status for each displayed item
3. THE File_Manager SHALL maintain normal appearance for files and folders that are not in the database
4. THE File_Manager SHALL update visual indicators dynamically when database status changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a cleaner interface without expand/collapse all buttons, so that the interface is less cluttered and more focused.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE File_Manager SHALL remove the "Expand All" button from the interface
2. THE File_Manager SHALL remove the "Collapse All" button from the interface
3. THE File_Manager SHALL maintain all other existing navigation functionality
4. THE File_Manager SHALL preserve individual folder expand/collapse capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to stop a scanning operation while it's running, so that I can cancel long-running scans when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Scanning_Operation is in progress, THE File_Manager SHALL display a "Stop Scanning" button
2. WHEN the user clicks the stop button, THE File_Manager SHALL immediately terminate the current Scanning_Operation
3. THE File_Manager SHALL hide the stop button when no Scanning_Operation is active
4. WHEN a Scanning_Operation is stopped, THE File_Manager SHALL display a status message indicating the operation was cancelled
5. THE File_Manager SHALL preserve any data that was successfully scanned before the operation was stopped
